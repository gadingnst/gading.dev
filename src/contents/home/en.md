I'm currently working full-time remotely at [SIRCLO](https://sirclo.com) on the [Orami's](https://orami.co.id) Core Engineering team.

Passionate to explore about modern mobile and web technology while taking into consideration about *DX (Developer Experience)*, the latest trends, and techniques. And also, I would be a fast learner in doing new things and building good teamwork either.

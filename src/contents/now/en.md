At first, I'll be thanking to [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now) and [Afrijal Dzuhri](https://afrijaldzuhri.wordpress.com/now). Because all of them, I was inspired to create and add new content on this page for describing about ***what I'm doing right now***. So, maybe you don't need to ask me frequently about that.

> If you have your own site, maybe you should to make one, too.

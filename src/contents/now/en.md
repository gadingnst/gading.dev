At first, I'll be thanking to [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now), [Fariz Rizaldy](https://faultable.dev/now/), [Afrijal Dzuhri](https://afrijaldzuhri.wordpress.com/now), [Afwa Bagas Wahuda](https://www.wahudamon.com/now), and [Iyan Saputra](https://iyansr.id/now). Because all of them, I was inspired to create and add new content on this page for describing about ***what I'm doing right now***. So, maybe you don't need to ask me frequently about that.

I'm a ***Software Engineer*** with over 5 years of experience, mainly working with ***TypeScript*** and ***React***.

I'm passionate about exploring emerging technologies like ***AI***, ***Web3***, and ***blockchain*** while also diving deep into modern mobile & web tech with a strong focus on *DX (Developer Experience)*, performance, and staying ahead of the curve.

I’m a fast learner and a team player. I’ve built several side and *open-source* projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/gadingnst), which may have helped fellow devs out there.

#### Spelling my name
Before you get to know me, make sure you pronounce my name right:

✅ ***Correct***:
- Sutan
- Gading *(recommended)*
- Fadhillah
- Nasution

❌ ***Incorrect***:
- Sultan *(adding `L`)*
- Gilang *(how did we get here?)*
- Fadillah *(missing `H`)*
- Fadhilah *(missing one `L`)*
- Fadilah *(missing `H` and one `L`)*

#### The story behind "Gading"
I’m a lifelong learner. Communities, open source, mentors, and friends all helped shape me. I love sharing knowledge too — through OSS, docs, and blog posts. That’s how I realized I enjoy technical writing and teaching dev stuff.

#### Curious about what I'm up to?

#### About this website
This site is built with *JAMStack* using *Next.js*. You can peek the source-code [here](https://github.com/gadingnst/gading.dev). It’s fully static, written in Markdown, no DB attached. If you're into this stuff, do some research on JAMStack — it's a whole ecosystem, not just Next.js.

I care a lot about performance and SEO, so I’m showcasing a live website performance report on this page. Shoutout to [Ankur Parihar](https://github.com/ankurparihar) for [Readme Pagespeed Insight](https://github.com/ankurparihar/readme-pagespeed-insights)!

I'm ***Software Engineer*** who specialized in ***Frontend*** on *Full-time* work, and also has some ability to code in ***Fullstack*** on *Part-time/Freelance*.

I'm passionate in exploring about modern mobile and web technology while taking into consideration about *DX (Developer Experience)*, the latest trends, and techniques.

My main focus is on improving DX in the Frontend team, such as setup the boilerplate, architecture, standardization, creating utilities/libraries, research, and improving the reliability structure in codebases. My works is mostly on building services that are not *end-to-end products* on the Frontend side.

I would be a fast learner in doing new things and building good teamwork either. Also, made several side or *open-source* projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/gadingnst) for fun, and maybe already useful for people who have used it.

#### Spelling my name
Before getting to know more about someone, the first thing you should do is knowing how to pronounce their name properly.
Here are the names you can use to call me:

###### ✅ These are ***correct*** :
- Sutan
- Gading *(recommended)*
- Fadhillah
- Nasution

###### ❌ These are ***incorrect*** :
- Sultan *(adding `L`)*
- Gilang *(I don't know why some people going so far in spelling my name)*
- Fadillah *(missing `H`)*
- Fadhilah *(missing one `L`)*
- Fadilah *(missing `H` and one `L`)*

#### The story behind "Gading"
I’m a *long-life learner person*. Online developer communities, OSS projects, mentors sharing their knowledge (for free & paid), colleagues, and friends, all those people helped me get to where I am today. And I’m very grateful for that. Early on I also helped out people, contributed to some OSS projects and published my own projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/gadingnst?tab=repositories). That’s how I realized that I enjoy technical writing like in blog or software documentation, and creating educational content & interacting with another developers.

#### More questions about me?
Before asking me more, you can check my [Now](/now) page to know about what I'm doing in daily, maybe there you'll find the answer.

#### About this website
I built this website using *JAMStack* with *Next.js* technology, you can check the source-code [here](https://github.com/gadingnst/gading.dev). All content on this website mostly is written using *Markdown* (no database included). If you want to make one too, then I suggest you learn about *JAMStack* first, *JAMStack* technology is quite extensive, there are many technologies or frameworks that you can use to build a *JAMStack-based* website, not just using *Next.js*. You can *DYOR*.

In building this website, I really paid attention to all aspects related to *performance* and *SEO*. Therefore, I'll display the website *performance* report on this page, and it will always be updated periodically. Thanks to [Ankur Parihar](https://github.com/ankurparihar) for making [Readme Pagespeed Insight](https://github.com/ankurparihar/readme-pagespeed-insights) that can generate *performance* report of this website automatically. Here's the last updated report:

##### *Performance* Report (Desktop)
<PerformanceReportsDesktop />

##### *Performance* Report (Mobile)
